# AI Chatbot Application

This project is an AI-powered chatbot developed for an organization.  
The frontend is built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, while the backend is developed with **Flask (Python)**.  
The chatbot is trained using **NLP techniques** with **NLTK**, and custom **intents** were created to handle organization-specific queries.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User sends a message from the React UI.
2. Flask API receives the request.
3. NLTK processes the text and matches it with trained intents.
4. The best response is returned and displayed in the chat interface.

## 🏢 Organization Training

The chatbot was trained using a custom **intents JSON file** containing organization-specific:
- FAQs
- Services
- Policies
- General support queries

This allows the bot to respond accurately based on the organization's domain.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add database for conversation history
- Improve model accuracy with deep learning
- Admin panel to manage intents dynamically
- Authentication for internal use
